# Universal Entity Engine (UEE)
## Glossary of Terms  
### Audience: AI Agents • Developers • Architects • Non‑Technical Readers

---

# 📘 1. Introduction

This glossary defines the foundational vocabulary of the **Universal Entity Engine (UEE)** — the conceptual operating system for entity‑centric, event‑sourced, AI‑enhanced applications.

Terms are written for:
- **AI Agents**, so they can reason about system components  
- **Developers**, so they can integrate and extend the engine  
- **Non‑technical readers**, so the system remains accessible  

---

# 🧩 2. Core Concepts

### **Entity**
The atomic data unit in the UEE.  
Everything — tasks, users, workflows, ML models, plugins, UI definitions, telemetry — is expressed as an entity.

---

### **Entity Version**
A numbered revision of an entity.  
UEE stores **every version** immutably using event sourcing.

---

### **EntityType**
An entity that describes the *schema* or *structure* of other entities.  
Applications can define their own EntityTypes at runtime.

---

### **Attributes**
The domain-specific data of an entity (stored as JSON/BSON).  
Flexible, schema‑free, tenant‑extensible.

---

### **Metadata**
System-related fields used for visibility, tenancy, permissions, indexing, and processing behavior.

---

# 🧱 3. Architecture & Storage Terms

### **Event**
An immutable fact describing a change to an entity.  
Example: `TaskCreated`, `TaskUpdated`, `RelationshipAdded`.

---

### **Event Store**
The append‑only MongoDB collection where all events are stored chronologically.

---

### **Latest Pointer**
A `latest` collection entry that tracks the newest version for each `entityId`.

---

### **Event Sourcing**
A persistence strategy where all changes are stored as events, and state is rebuilt from these events.

---

### **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
A pattern that separates:
- **Commands** → Write operations  
- **Queries** → Read operations  

UEE uses CQRS natively.

---

### **Read Model**
A precomputed, query‑optimized projection of entity data.

---

### **Projection**
A background process that consumes events and builds or updates read models.

---

### **Rebuild**
The process of replaying all events to reconstruct read models from scratch.

---

# 🔌 4. Plugin & Execution Terms

### **Plugin**
A sandboxed module (often WASM) that extends UEE functionality — workflows, ML inference, projections, validators, analytics.

---

### **WASM Plugin**
A WebAssembly-based plugin that runs safely inside UEE's execution sandbox.

---

### **Plugin Capability Model**
The permissions granted to a plugin, such as:
- Reading entities  
- Writing entities  
- Publishing events  
- Updating read models  
- Accessing ML models  

---

### **Workflow Plugin**
A plugin that defines custom workflows, state machines, or multi-step automations.

---

### **ML Plugin**
A plugin that performs machine learning operations, such as:
- Feature extraction  
- Inference  
- Model monitoring  
- Suggestion generation  

---

### **Host API**
The restricted set of functions exposed to plugins.

---

# 📡 5. Telemetry & ML Terms

### **Telemetry**
Behavioral, structural, and system-level signals generated by:
- Users  
- Plugins  
- Events  
- Workflows  
- ML models  
- The UEE system itself  

Telemetry = the nervous system of the engine.

---

### **Feature Extraction**
The process of transforming telemetry into structured ML‑ready features (done via plugins).

---

### **ML Model**
A predictive model used for personalization, recommendations, classification, clustering, or optimization.

---

### **Model Drift**
A phenomenon where an ML model becomes less accurate over time due to changing user behavior or domain conditions.

---

### **User Profile (AI Profile)**
A read model describing a user’s behavioral patterns, energy patterns, preferences, and learned embeddings.

---

### **Adaptive Workflow**
Any workflow that changes over time in response to telemetry and ML feedback.

---

### **Closed‑Loop Personalization**
The full AI adaptation cycle:
1. Telemetry  
2. Feature extraction  
3. ML inference  
4. Personalized read models  
5. UI adaptation  
6. New telemetry  

---

# 🏢 6. Multitenancy & Visibility Terms

### **Tenant**
A logical customer or organization using the UEE.

---

### **User**
A member belonging to a tenant or a standalone tenant (single‑user mode).

---

### **Global Entity**
An entity with `tenantId = null` and `ownerId = null`.  
Shared across all tenants.

---

### **Tenant Entity**
An entity visible to all users within a tenant.

---

### **User Entity**
An entity visible only to a specific user.

---

### **Visibility Rules**
Determined entirely by:
- `tenantId`
- `ownerId`

No separate schemas or databases.

---

# 🛰️ 7. Caching & Performance Terms

### **L1 Cache**
In‑process, per-node memory cache.

---

### **L2 Cache**
Redis-based distributed caching layer shared across API nodes.

---

### **Hot Path**
A code or query path optimized for high‑frequency, low‑latency access.

---

### **Backpressure**
A mechanism allowing event consumers to slow down safely under heavy load.

---

# 🧪 8. Application Development Terms

### **Client Application**
Any external application built on the UEE — such as DivFlo, CRM Lite, Notes, Scheduler, etc.

---

### **Materialized View**
A read model representing a specific UI or domain concept.

---

### **Behavioral UX**
A user interface that adapts automatically based on user behavior or ML signals.

---

### **Experiment (A/B Test)**
An entity describing a controlled variation of UI/UX logic.

---

# 🔗 9. Cross‑Application Terms

### **Shared Telemetry Graph**
The unified behavioral data layer across all apps in the tenant.

---

### **Inter-App Personalization**
One app uses insights learned by another — e.g., CRM uses energy patterns from DivFlo.

---

### **Ecosystem Plugin**
A plugin available to multiple apps within a tenant.

---

### **Cross‑Domain Read Model**
A read model combining data from multiple application domains.

---

# 🧠 10. AI Agent Terms

### **AI Agent**
A system (LLM or otherwise) that uses UEE APIs to:
- Generate entities  
- Build plugins  
- Modify read models  
- Run experiments  
- Evolve workflows  

UEE is designed for AI-native operations.

---

### **AI‑Generated Plugin**
A plugin produced entirely by an AI agent, compiled to WASM, and deployed through UEE.

---

### **AI‑Generated Schema / EntityType**
EntityTypes created at runtime by an AI agent to support new domain models.
